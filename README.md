# Advent of Rust 2017

These are my solutions to [2017's Advent of Code challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2017), written in Rust.

The program expects the puzzle input on standard input, and the day is passed as the first argument, for example:

    cargo run --release -- $DAY < inputs/$DAY

* [Day 1: Inverse Captcha](src/day1/)
* [Day 2: Corruption Checksum](src/day2/)
* [Day 3: Spiral Memory](src/day3/)
* [Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases](src/day4/)
* [Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike](src/day5/)
* [Day 6: Memory Reallocation](src/day6/)
* [Day 7: Recursive Circus](src/day7/)
* [Day 8: I Heard You Like Registers](src/day8/)
* [Day 9: Stream Processing](src/day9/)
* [Day 10: Knot Hash](src/day10/)
* [Day 11: Hex Ed](src/day11/)
* [Day 12: Digital Plumber](src/day12/)
* [Day 13: Packet Scanners](src/day13/)
* [Day 14: Disk Defragmentation](src/day14/)
* [Day 15: Dueling Generators](src/day15/)
* [Day 16: Permutation Promenade](src/day16/)
* [Day 17: Spinlock](src/day17/)
* [Day 18: Duet](src/day18/)
* [Day 19: A Series of Tubes](src/day19/)
* [Day 20: Particle Swarm](src/day20/)
* [Day 21: Fractal Art](src/day21/)
* [Day 22: Sporifica Virus](src/day22/)
* [Day 23: Coprocessor Conflagration](src/day23/)
